# 📰 Credibility-Detector
Tl;dr: Machine Learning project predicting website credibility using HTML/CSS features (Random Forest &amp; XGBoost)

---

A Machine Learning project that predicts the **credibility of websites** using their **HTML/CSS structure**.  
Built as part of my Master’s thesis in *Data Science & Society*.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal**: Classify websites as credible or not credible based on structural features.  
- **Approach**: Extracted features from HTML and CSS, then trained supervised ML models.  
- **Models used**: Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Result**: Achieved strong performance with F1-score up to 0.92.
